Objective:
Design and implement a console-based Student Management System in Python using basic programming concepts, including:
Input/Output, Operators, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Control Structures (if-else, loops)etc.

Task Description:
Create an interactive Console -based system that allows the user to manage student records. The system should offer menu-driven options and must implement core Python fundamentals.

Functionality Requirements:
Your Student Management System should provide the following features:

1️⃣ Add Student Record
Input student details:
Name (string)
Roll Number (string/integer)
Age (integer)
Courses (store as a tuple)
Marks (store as a dictionary — subject as key, marks as value)

2️⃣ Display All Records
Show a summary of all student records.
Display Name, Roll No, Age, Courses, Marks, Average Marks, and Grade.

3️⃣ Search Student by Roll Number
Allow the user to enter a roll number.
Display all details of the corresponding student (if found).

4️⃣ Update Student Record
Modify student marks or details using their roll number.
Prompt for updated values (courses or marks).

5️⃣ Delete Student Record
Remove a student record using the roll number.

6️⃣ Calculate Average Marks
Calculate and display the average of marks for each student.
Based on the average, determine and display the grade:

A+ (>=90)
A (>=75)
B (>=60)
C (>=40)
Fail (<40)

7️⃣ Exit
Exit the program gracefully with a thank-you message.
